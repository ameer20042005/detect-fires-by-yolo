The YOLO (You Only Look Once) project is an object detection system using artificial intelligence. It was developed to detect fires by training it on images and videos containing fires and smoke. After training, the model detects fires in real time, which helps in early warning, forest monitoring, and enhancing safety in buildings and industrial areas.
